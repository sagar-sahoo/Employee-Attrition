# Employee-Attrition


Problem Statement

A client has a problem with employee attrition and they would like to know which employees are most likely to leave the company. The client wants to understand what is driving attrition and how to improve employee retention.

Approach

In order to understand the factors responsible for attrition we framed a Data Science Model. Since we have the employment end date available with us, we will consider them as Attrition employees. The employees without an end date means they are still in the organisation. We created a binary response using this approach. Next, we have several features which can be processed and fed into the Classification Model
Assumption - Attrition reports does not include layoff figures. When we report attrition and other employee-turnover rates, layoffs are reported as a separate factor from attrition in the staffing numbers (Source - https://smallbusiness.chron.com/count-layoffs-attrition-37044.html)

We will follow the popular CRISM DM Methodolgy (CRoss-InduStry Process for Data Mining) for our problem:-

Business understanding
Data understanding & Exploratory Data Analysis
Data pre-processing
Modeling & Evaluation
Model Execution/Deployment

Based on the insights from EDA and Predictive Modeling, we can focus on creating strategies on how to prevent employees from leaving the company. It will be a collaboration of Data Scientists, HR, Management Team to understand the factors and meet with employees to better understand work load and satisfaction and reducing attrition.
